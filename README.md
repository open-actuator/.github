# Open Actuator ‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to **Open Actuator**, an open-source community dedicated to developing flexible and unified tools for robotic actuators.

Our goal is to simplify actuator integration and control, enabling more efficient and scalable engineering workflows.

## Repositories

- [**legato**](https://github.com/open-actuator/legato): A unified actuator SDK providing consistent APIs for various robotic actuators.
- [**legato_ros2**](https://github.com/open-actuator/legato_ros2): ROS2 integration for the Legato SDK, making actuator control seamless within ROS2 ecosystems.

## Contributing üíö

We warmly welcome contributions from the robotics community! Feel free to report issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.
